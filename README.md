# Game Hub

## Description

Game Hub is a partial clone of the video game database, RAWG, using Vite React and Chakra UI for styling. It uses node.js and express.js for a RESTful API to keep the rawg API key secure. The user can filter games by genre, sort the games by platform and order the games by a number of properties, as well as search for games using a search input.
